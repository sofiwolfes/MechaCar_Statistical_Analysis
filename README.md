# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Review of the production data to help the manufacturing team troubleshoot and bring insides of the process.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils



## T-Tests on Suspension Coils


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition


As the data we have from the MechaCar reflects mpg and it was found it was somewhat reliable to take it as a statistically significant, we could compare with dataset of mpg of different brands.

Highway Miles per Galon consumed could be used to compare as they represents the highest values (optimal use). We could determine if Horsepower vs mpg relationship is similar or better than the other cars.

Null Hypothesis: No statistical diference.

Alternative Hypothesis: Statistically potential indicator of a better performance.

Data about the horsepower of the MechaCars need to be collected and a two-sample t-test could be perfomed to determine the statistical difference between the distribution means form the two.
